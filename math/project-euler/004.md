# The Problem

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is: 101101 = 143 x 707.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.

Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

## First Solution (slow)



## Second Solution (fast)

The second solution was faster than the previous one.

```python
def palindrom(n):
    isPalindrom = lambda x: str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
    st, maxPalindrom = 999, 0
    while st > 99:
        b, d_b = (999, 1) if st % 11 == 0 else (990, 11)
        while b >= st:
            r = st * b
            if r < maxPalindrom:
                break
            if r < n and isPalindrom(r):
                maxPalindrom = r
            b -= d_b
        st -= 1
    return maxPalindrom


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        print(palindrom(int(input())))
```
