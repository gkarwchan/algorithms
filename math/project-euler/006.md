# The problem

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2+ .... + 10^2 = 385.  
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+3+...+10)^2 = 3025.  
Hence the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385=2640.

Find the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.


# The solution

```python
def sumsquarediff(n):
    sum_square = (2 * n**3 + 3 * n ** 2 + n) // 6
    square_sum = ((n * (n+1)) // 2) ** 2
    return square_sum - sum_square


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        print (sumsquarediff(int(input())))
```
