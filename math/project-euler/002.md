# The problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `N`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## First solution

```python
def even_fibonacci(n):  
    first, second, sum = 1, 2, 0
    while second < n:
        sum += second if second % 2 == 0 else 0
        first, second = second, first
        second += first
        
    return sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input().strip())
    for a in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        print(even_fibonacci(n))

```

## Second solution
the second solution start from the formula that
E(n) = 4*E(n-1) + E(n-2)

```python
def even_fibonacci(n):  
    first, second, sum = 0, 2, 0
    while second < n:
        sum += second
        first, second = second, first
        second = 4 * first + second
        
    return sum
```
