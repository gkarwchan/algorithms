# The problem

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible(divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to N?

Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.


## The solution

The smaller number is the LCM for many numbers:

the lcm for many numbers is as follows:

```matlab
lcm(x,y,z) = lcm(x, lcm(y,z))
```

To use Python

```python

def gcd(a, b):
    while(b):
        a, b = b, a%b
    return a

def lcm(a, b=None, *rest):
    if b == None:
        return a
    rslt = (a*b) // gcd(a, b)
    if rest:
        return lcm(rslt, rest[0], *rest[1:])
    else:
        return rslt
        
    


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        numbers = [x for x in range(1, n + 1)]
        print (lcm(*numbers))

```
