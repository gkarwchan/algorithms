# Statistics


## Sampling:

there are these types of sampling:

1. Random Sampling:  
The sample is randomley selected to avoid bias.  
Chosing a random simple isn't as simple as it seems.

2. Systematic Sampling:  
this method select the sample according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval.  
The interval is called `sampling interval1, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.

3. Stratified Sampling:  
Stratified sampling refers to a type of sampling method . With stratified sampling, the researcher divides the population into separate groups, called strata. Then, a probability sample (often a simple random sample ) is drawn from each group.

Stratified sampling has several advantages over simple random sampling. For example, using stratified sampling, it may be possible to reduce the sample size required to achieve a given precision. Or it may be possible to increase the precision with the same sample size.

## Types of statistical studies:

* Sample Study:  


* Observational Study:  
Study existing population


* Experimental Study:  
Apply the study on people.
