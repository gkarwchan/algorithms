# Statistics


## Descriptive Statistics:

It is the summary of the data, like the following:  

1. Average
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Variance:  
    - Kurtosis
    - Skewness
    - Standard Deviation

#### Average:  

* arithmatic mean: sum all divided by how many numbers.
(central tendency)

#### Median:

middle number after sort the numbers.

#### Mode:  

The most common number in the dataset.


#### Interquartile:

median of the whole, median the first half (Q1) and median of the second half (Q2)


## Measure of spread: (distribution of data)

1. range
2. variance
3. standard deviation
4. interquartile range


## Sampling:

there are these types of sampling:

1. Random Sampling:  
The sample is randomley selected to avoid bias.  
Chosing a random simple isn't as simple as it seems.

2. Systematic Sampling:  
this method select the sample according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval.  
The interval is called `sampling interval1, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.

3. Stratified Sampling:  
Stratified sampling refers to a type of sampling method . With stratified sampling, the researcher divides the population into separate groups, called strata. Then, a probability sample (often a simple random sample ) is drawn from each group.

Stratified sampling has several advantages over simple random sampling. For example, using stratified sampling, it may be possible to reduce the sample size required to achieve a given precision. Or it may be possible to increase the precision with the same sample size.

## Types of statistical studies:

* Sample Study:  


* Observational Study:  
Study existing population


* Experimental Study:  
Apply the study on people.
