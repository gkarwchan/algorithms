Mega millions has two bowls, one with 56 balls, and the second with 46 balls.  

1. draw 5 balls from the first bowl, and they should all match with any order.
2. draw 1 ball from the 46 (mega ball), should match

ρ(winning) = ρ(56,5) * 46

ρ(56,5) 56ρ5 = 56! / ( (56 - 5)! * 5!) = 3,819,816

ρ(winning) = 3,819,816 * 46 = 175,711,536
