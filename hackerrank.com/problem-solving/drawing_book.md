# Drawing Book

Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number. Brie can either start
turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page
number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at
