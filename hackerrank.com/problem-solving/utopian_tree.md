# Utopian	Tree

The	Utopian	Tree	goes	through	 2 	cycles	of	growth	every	year.	Each	spring,	it	doubles	in	height.	Each
summer,	its	height	increases	by	 1 	meter.
Laura	plants	a	Utopian	Tree	sapling	with	a	height	of	 1 	meter	at	the	onset	of	spring.	How	tall	will	her	tree	be
after	 	growth	cycles?
**Input	Format**
The	first	line	contains	an	integer,	 ,	the	number	of	test	cases.	
	subsequent	lines	each	contain	an	integer,	 ,	denoting	the	number	of	cycles	for	that	test	case.
**Constraints**

**Output	Format**
For	each	test	case,	print	the	height	of	the	Utopian	Tree	after	 	cycles.	Each	height	must	be	printed	on	a
new	line.
**Sample	Input**

(^30)
(^14)
**Sample	Output**
(^12)
7
**Explanation**
There	are	 3 	test	cases.
In	the	first	case	( ),	the	initial	height	( )	of	the	tree	remains	unchanged.
In	the	second	case	( ),	the	tree	doubles	in	height	and	is	 	meters	tall	after	the	spring	cycle.
In	the	third	case	( ),	the	tree	doubles	its	height	in	spring	( ),	then	grows	a	meter	in	summer	(
),	then	doubles	after	the	next	spring	( ),	and	grows	another	meter	after	summer	( ).
Thus,	at	the	end	of	4	cycles,	its	height	is	 	meters.
