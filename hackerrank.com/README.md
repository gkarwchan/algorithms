# Hacker Rank Web site

[hacker Rank] (hackerrank.com) is a web site that provides code challenges.  
I am trying to solve these problems using three languages:  

1. python
2. scala
3. JavaScript

Each file match a problem on the website and has the URL for the problem on the website in the first list of the file.
